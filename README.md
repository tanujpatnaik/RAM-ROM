# RAM-ROM Implementation

## Overview
This Verilog module implements RAM a volatile memory that temporarily stores data and instructions needed by CPU for processing.And ROM a non-volatile memory that permanently stores essential data and firmware.

## Features of RAM
- Provides fast data access for the CPU.
- Can both read and write data quickly.
- Stores data needed for running programs and processes.
- Data is lost when power is turned off.

## Features of ROM
- Data is permanently stored and cannot be modified easily.
- Holds essential system instructions like BIOS and bootloader.
- Used in embedded systems, microcontrollers, and hardware programming.
- Retains data even when power is off.
